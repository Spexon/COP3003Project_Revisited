# Production Line Project Revisited

In this project I go through my previous project that I've created a year ago (COP3003Project) and retry what I didnt understand. 
I added new features that improved the UI and overall functionality of the GUI program, as well as refreshed my understanding with 
Object Oriented concepts. This project was worked upon while being a TA for one of my professors.
